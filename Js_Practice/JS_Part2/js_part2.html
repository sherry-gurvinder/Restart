        Summary
A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. JavaScript code may be executed in one of two runtime environments:

a browser’s runtime environment
the Node runtime environment
In each of these environments, different data values and functions are available, and these differences help distinguish front-end applications from back-end applications.

Front-end JavaScript applications are executed in a browser’s runtime environment and have access to the window object.
Back-end JavaScript applications are executed in the Node runtime environment and have access to the file system, databases, and networks attached to the server.
